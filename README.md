Batman Rails Demo
-----------------

Using [Batman.js](http://www.batmanjs.org), do the following:

1) Simple form CRUD
2) Routing of resources - nested too
3) Associations - has_many, belongs_to
4) Rails idiom and integration - shouldn't be an impedance mismatch
5) Data binding - views change automatically when data does
6) View Composition - weak, strong...just get it done
7) No Framework Poison Pills - that would be bugs and things that would jeopardize a production app

Optional
7) Real-time - Pusher
